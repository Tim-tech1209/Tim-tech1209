Welcome to my channel!
This space documents my hands-on journey of building cloud infrastructure from the ground up.
I'm combining IaC with coding best practices to create reproducible and scalable solutions on Azure.

To thoroughly test my infrastructure, I'm also developing a companion Python application.
As a newcomer to coding, the initial iterations might be rough around the edges, but each project is a step forward.
I'm committed to continuous learning and refinement.

The goal is to evolve these projects into a comprehensive, portfolio-ready system that mirrors the architecture shown below.
